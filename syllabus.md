Abstract Algebra, Syllabus and Course Structure
---

**Welcome to synchronous remote Abstract Algebra!**


Material
---

This is primarily a course in group theory.
Our main source will be **Algebra** by Michael Artin, either the first or second editions.

We will cover roughly the material in chapters 2, 6 and 7 of the second edition, which corresponds to chapters 2, 5 and 6 of the first edition.

Having access to the material in the textbook will be important.


Course Structure
---

Short assignments based on assigned reading will be made available Sunday and Tuesday evenings, due roughly 24 hours after being posted. These will be primarily graded for completion, and you will have the opportunity here to give feedback on your understanding of the material, so that I know which things are well understood and which things are less clear to everyone. In addition, there will be a standard length weekly homework assignment given out on Tuesday and due Thursday. Finally, once a month we will have longer cumulative homework assignments.

In the lectures, I will assume that all students have done the assigned reading. I will try to supplement the material by adding extra details and examples as needed. The format will likely be as much of a discussion as a lecture.

Grading
---

The course grade will be based on these homework assignments as follows:

- semiweekly assignments: 40% total (drop lowest 4)
- weekly assignments: 30% total (drop lowest 2)
- monthly assignments: 30% total (drop lowest 1)

How to be successful
---

To be successful in the course will require:

- Keeping up with readings in the textbook,
- Attending the lectures/discussions
- Keeping up with the written assignments,
- Asking questions via written assignments, email or during office hours whenever something is unclear.

In practical terms, if you want to do well in the course, it is absolutely essential that you keep up with the material in a timely way. Late homework will generally not be accepted.

Coffee Hours
---

On Wednesday, we will take some time for coffee hours/ office hours/ tea time. This will consist of an open Zoom meeting for roughly 1 hour where students can drop in and chat. While course questions will have precedence, everyone is welcome to come by and socialize as well.
